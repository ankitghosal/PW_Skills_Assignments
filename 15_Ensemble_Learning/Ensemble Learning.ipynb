    "* **Boosting** (e.g., XGBoost, AdaBoost) is preferred when you need to **reduce bias** and improve weak learners.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Handling Overfitting**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **cross-validation** and **early stopping** (for boosting models like XGBoost).\n",
    "* Tune parameters such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `max_depth` (shallower trees prevent overfitting)\n",
    "  * `learning_rate` (small values like 0.05–0.1)\n",
    "  * `n_estimators` (balance model complexity and accuracy)\n",
    "* Apply **regularization** (`lambda`, `alpha`) and **dropout** techniques in boosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Selecting Base Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start with **Decision Trees** as base learners (simple and diverse).\n",
    "* For experimentation, combine different learners (e.g., Logistic Regression + Tree + SVM) in **Stacking** for better diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Evaluating Performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation** to ensure balanced class representation.\n",
    "* Evaluate metrics like:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **ROC-AUC** (model discrimination power)\n",
    "  * **Precision, Recall, F1-score** (important for imbalanced data)\n",
    "  * **Confusion Matrix** for interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Business Justification**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ensemble models **increase prediction reliability** by aggregating multiple perspectives.\n",
    "* In a financial context, better predictions mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Reduced default risk**\n",
    "  * **Improved credit decision-making**\n",
    "  * **Higher profitability and lower losses**\n",
